Discovery of the Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), the mechanism of the CRISPR-based prokaryotic adaptive immune system (CRISPR-associated system, Cas), and its repurposing into a potent gene editing tool has revolutionized the field of molecular biology and generated excitement for new and improved gene therapies. Additionally, the simplicity and flexibility of the CRISPR/Cas9 site-specific nuclease system has led to its widespread use in many biological research areas including development of model cell lines, discovering mechanisms of disease, identifying disease targets, development of transgene animals and plants, and transcriptional modulation. In this review, we present the brief history and basic mechanisms of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and its predecessors (ZFNs and TALENs), lessons learned from past human gene therapy efforts, and recent modifications of CRISPR/Cas9 to provide functions beyond gene editing. We introduce several factors that influence CRISPR/Cas9 efficacy which must be addressed before effective in vivo human gene therapy can be realized. The focus then turns to the most difficult barrier to potential in vivo use of CRISPR/Cas9, delivery. We detail the various cargos and delivery vehicles reported for CRISPR/Cas9, including physical delivery methods (e.g. microinjection; electroporation), viral delivery methods (e.g. adeno-associated virus (AAV); full-sized adenovirus and lentivirus), and non-viral delivery methods (e.g. liposomes; polyplexes; gold particles), and discuss their relative merits.
